My boss asked me to create a tool for creating displaced geometries of cells for Quantum Espresso, so here it is :)
To use it, you need a pw.x input file and the matdyn.modes file. 
If something seems unclear for you, I am more than willing to help :)
Plans for the future:
- Creating GUI
- Making it possible to choose any vibration, not only the lowest one
- Creating the vibration by double click on the point in the plot.
If anything comes to your mind, I will be glad to hear your opinion.
